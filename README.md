# Basic Math Expression Evaluator

Mini project to understand how to lex, parse and interpret simple math expressions. Follows the order of operations and good to understand how lexing and parsing could be used if trying to do a similar thing in a compiled programming language like C (which should hopefully be my next project).

To run the shell:
> python3 main.py

To run the test cases:
> python3 -m unittest tests
